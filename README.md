Image Search

A simple application of image search using UnsplashAPI.

The Components are divided into Search Bar, Image List, Image Card and the main parent component, namely, App.

To render the images in alignment and without any noticeable whitespace, image reference(ref) is used to get the height of the image after it is rendered and setting the grid rows dynamically using the reference of that image.
